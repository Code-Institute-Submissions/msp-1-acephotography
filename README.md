# ACE Photography Website
 
## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
This website is intended to both showcase the work by Ashwin Vijayaraghavan, as well as attract people to contact him for any business needs.
He is a young and starting photographer, with a great eye for detail, and a passion for making the right pictures for any occasion.

Besides his passion for insect photography, he also shoots portraits, events, landscapes, foods and has already had several advertisement assignments.
 
### What does it do?
 
The site opens with a slideshow of pictures as background, immediately shocasing some photos, before going into an about page, then to a contact area.
A large button on the first page opens up a gallery with more pictures, titled with the various categories of pictures he shoots.
 
### How does it work
 
This website is styled using **Bootstrap**, specifically version 3.3.7.
The background consists of a standard bootstrap carousel, tweaked to work as background.
In order to ensure that the mobile pulldown menu auto-closes, a small additional **Javascript** snippet was added.
**FontAwesome** and **Hover.CSS** were both used whenever icons and/or animations were added.
